## Overview

This Week 5 introduced advanced concepts crucial for handling real-world data and writing flexible, maintainable Java applications. We began with working on CSV files - reading, writing, and processing structured data from external files. Then we explored JSON data formats and how to parse and generate JSON using popular Java libraries. The week concluded with a deep dive into powerful Java features like annotations and reflection, along with key object-oriented design principles that guide building robust and scalable software systems.
